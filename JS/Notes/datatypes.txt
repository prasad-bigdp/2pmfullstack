Javascript is dynamically typed language
The datatype of a variable is decided by elements value in it. it can be changed with value.
changing one datatype to another datatype is called "type casting". There are two types of type casting i.e., implicit and explicit
implicit, without external force, it converts one data type to another
explicit, we need force to convert one data type to another

There are two classifications of datatypes in Javascript
I. primitive Data Types:
i. number: number is data type assigned to any numerical value
eg:5,5.369
ii.string: string is a collection of characters.String can be represented by ' or ". 
eg:'raj',"ravi"
iii.boolean: it is used to declare tru or false. Teue is 1 and false is 0.
iv.undefined: it is used to store "undefined" data
v.null: it is used to store "null" data
II.non-Primitve Data Types:
i. functions:
ii.Arrays
iii. objects



i. number: Any numerical data is number , to find datatype of an element , we can use typeof operator
numbers have some default method called "Math Methods"
