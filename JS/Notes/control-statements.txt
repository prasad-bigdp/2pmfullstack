Control statements or Decision Making statements are used to constrol user flow based on a decision. The popular Decision making statements are if and switch
1. if: if statement is used to manage the flow of program based on a condition
we have different variantions of if such as 
   -- simple if:
   if(condition){
    //statement
   }
   // Write a function that prints/alerts success when username passed is javascript
//input: fun("javascript")
//success
function display1 (str)
{
    if (str === "javascript")
    {
        console.log("success")
    }
}
display1("javascript")

 -- if--else
if(condition)
 //statements
 else 
 //statements




 --if-else-if : it is used to check multiple conditions
 if(condition)
 //statements
 else if(another condition)
 //statements
 else 
 //statements
But multiple ifs make the code lengths, To solve this probelm , we used
switch-case

switch: switch is an alternative to if-else-if ladder. it solves the probelm by writing each condition as a case
switch(expression/statement){
    case val1:
    case val2:
    case val3:
    ...
    default:
}
default will be triggered when none of the above cases are matched.Try to keep default at last
If 'break' keyword is not mentioned in switch , it falls to the next case called "fall-through error"
break is used the end the execution to the nearest block
