Operators are used to perform an operation between the operands
for eg: a + b perform addition operation with a and b as operands and + as Operators

i. Arithematic operators: These operators are used to perform Arithematic operations on two or more operands like
  Addition(+),subtraction(-),multiplication(*),division(/),modulus(% -- remainder), Exponation( ** )

ii. incremenet and decrement operators: These operators are used to increase/decrease the value by 1
++ is denoted as increment operator
-- is denoted as decrement operator
  pre incr/pre decr --- first update and then return
  post incr/post decr -- first return and then update
eg: a=5;
var p= ++a;
var k= a++;
console.log(p+k)
x=5
var z= x--;
var y=--x;
console.log(z-y);

iii. relational operators:
relational operators are used to compare two values. Mostly they return boolean values
like greater than(>), less than(<), greater than or equals to(>=),less than or equals to(<=),double equals(compare two values -- ==), triple equals (===),not equals(!=),strict not equals(!==)


Assignment Opertaors:
Assignment Operators are used to assign the values. These are also called shorthand operators like
+= , -= , *= ,/= ,%= ,**=,=

Logical Operators: 
Logical Operators are used to combine some statements for comparison like 'and','or','not'

Ternary operator or conditional operator:
It is used to check the conditional and execute/assign different values based on condition
var a=15;
var k= (a>10) ? 5 : 10;
k will be 5 since the condition is true


//special operators
 i. unary + : unary + is used to convert any data type to number 
   console.log(2 + +'2')
 ii. unary -: unary - is used to negate the value
 var x=20;
 var y = -x;
 console.log(y) //-20
 iii. typeof : typeof is used to  find the datatype of a value
 var a=20;
 console.log(typeof(a)); //number
iv. Nullish(??): Nullish operator is used to assign a value based on whether the first value is undefined or not
var x= a ?? b;
if a is undefined , x=b else x value will be a
v. Optional Chaining(?.):
it is used to check whether given peoperty existed in the object or not
eg: obj?.name
