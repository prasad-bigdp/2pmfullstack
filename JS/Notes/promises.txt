Every Asynchronous actually returns promise.
A Promise is an object to describe an eventual completion of asynchronous operation.

Before Promises, we used to use "callbacks" for asynchronous js, it leads to a probelm "callback hell"

syntax: new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
    //promise logic
})

we can use in real time for API's
