Objects:Object is a collect of key-value pairs where each key is a string abd values can be any data types. keys are connected to values
object creation: 
  1. object literal:
  var obj={
    name:"raj",
    age:28
  }
We can access object project properties by
    --- dot notation: objectname.propertyName
    --- index signature: objectname['propertyName']
  2. using constructor function: constructor functions are the functions that returns an object

  function Person(a,b,c){
   this.name= a;
   this.age= b;
   this.job=c;
  }
  var obj=new Person("sudeep",55,"Developer");
    var obj2=new Person("raj",25,"panipuri")
console.log(obj.name)
  // 'this' is a keyword that points to current calling object

  3. object.create method: This way of creating object is used when we have to create one based based on another object
