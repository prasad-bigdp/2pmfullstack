Loops are used to iterate a certain statements. They iterate on a certain condition and until the condition fails.
Loops are basically two types
i. entry control loops:They check the condition first and runs the flow only if it is true
eg: while,for
ii. exit control loops: They check the condition at the exit time, so in the worst conditions it gains a free iteration
eg: do-while

i. while: while is a entry control loop used to iterate ceratin statements
syntax:
   initialization;
   while(condition){
    statements;
    updation
   }

ii. do-while: do while is used as an exit control loop to iterate certain statements
syntax:
   initialization;
   do{
    statements;
    updation
   }while(condition);

iii. for: for is used to iterate certain statements and for displays initialization, condition and updation in single statement

for(initialization;condition;updation){
    //statements
}

for..of :
for..of is used to iterate through the array ans brings the element each iteration

for(var i of arr){
   console.log(i) // i is a element of the array
}

for..in:
for..in is used to iterate through the array ans brings the index each iteration
for(var i in arr){
   console.log(i) //i is the index of the element in array
}
