Box model considers every element in UI as box.
A box will have 4 attributes
 --- border: outermost of any box is called border
    border: border-size border-style border-color;
  we can also assign spefic border by border-left,border-right,border-top,border-bottom
 --- border-radius: border-radius is nothing but corner radius of an element/box.
   border-radius:size;
   we can also set border-top-left-radius,border-top-right-radius,border-bottom-left-radius,border-bottom-right-radius
 ---  padding: padding is the space between border and content
 padding:size; it applies padding to all sides
 padding: size1 size2; it applies top and bottom size1 and left and right size2

 -- Increase in padding generally, it increases height and width also.
 we can set box-sizing:border-box to maintain same height and width

 -- margin: margin is th space outside the border. it can be applied similar to padding
