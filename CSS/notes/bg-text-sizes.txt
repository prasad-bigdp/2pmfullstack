we can assign colors in multiple ways
--- colour name;
--- hexcode
--- rgb(value1,value2,value3) -- each color will take 0-255 value
--- rgba(value1,value2,value3,alpha)  where alpha will be between 0.0 to 1.0
--- hsl(hue,saturation,lightness) -- hue will be degrees from 0 to 359, saturation and lightness are 0 to 100%
--- hsla(hue,saturation,lightness,alpha)
--- linear-gradient(color1,color2.....)
--- radial-gradient(color1,color2....) -- color transitions are circular
