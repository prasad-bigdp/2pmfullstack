Headings:
   Headings are used to display important or main words to represent context.
   Main Headings will have h1, followed by sub heading h2 and sub sub headings h3 . Each heading is differed by size and importance
   h1 is given higher importance like page title. It is recommanded to use only one h1 per page
   In case of h7 or any other unrecogizable tags , HTML treats them as normal paragraph. Total 6 headings are ther from h1 to h6.
Paragraph: Paragraph are used to display block of text in normal way. we use p tag for paragraph. To generate dummy paragraph, we can use 'lorem' or 'lorem50'(for 50 words).
Anchor: Anchor tag is used to link one page to another page/external resources
we use 'a' tag for anchor. it has an attribute href (hyper reference) contains value 'path to redirect'
<a href="https://www.google.com">click me</a>  --- redirects to google.com
<a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">click me</a>--- redirects to google.com in a new tab
<a href="some.pdf" download>click me</a>  --- it will download the pdf
<a href="mailto:abc@gmail.com">click me</a> -- go to the mail
<a href="tel:58588585">click me</a>

image: To display images we use img tag. img is a self closing tag.no need of closing img tag. img have two attributes (src and alt). 
  src-- src is used to give the link or path of image.
  alt -- alt works only when src path is not working.

we can also adjust height and width of image by respective attributes.
