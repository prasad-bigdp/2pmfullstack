Elements: elements are nothing but complete tag with its content i.e., open tag+content+close tag
for eg:
<h1>
   hello
</h1>
Note: all elements needs not to be closed. some elements don't have any closing tag. they are called void elements or empty elements or self closing elements
eg: <img src="" alt="" />,<br />,<hr />

we can group the elements and make the groups as block or inline for styling
  -- general grouping block element - div
  -- general grouping inline element - span
